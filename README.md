GoalsTracker is a way for support staff to track the number of hours they've worked or how many cases they've closed with in depth analysis of their progress toward hitting their goals.
Currently this is in the development stage and still has many features yet to be added. 

Upcoming features include: 
- Goal tracking
- Averages broken down per week and quarter
- Visualizations to show close you are to your goal
- Calculations to show how many hours/cases you need per day to hit your goal by the end of the quarter
- User logins
- Ability to add days off to exclude those days from your goals
- Net work day counts in the selected time period

Future features:
- Integration with MS products to pull case and time entries from Dynamics
- Login with OAuth
