*Real-time goal tracking with dynamic calculations and historical data preservation*

## The Problem

My support team at Vermont Systems tracked performance goals using an Excel spreadsheet. Every version update required manual data migration, causing:
- ‚ùå Lost historical data
- ‚ùå Data migration errors  
- ‚ùå Hours wasted on repetitive transfers
- ‚ùå Risk of formula breakage with each update

## The Solution

Built a persistent web application that eliminates manual migrations while maintaining all Excel functionality‚Äîplus real-time calculations, historical tracking, and a cleaner interface.

*Track cases closed by quarter or custom date range with automatic average calculations*

**üìã Planned Features:**
- Daily goal tracking with progress indicators
- Weekly and quarterly average breakdowns
- Visualizations showing goal progress
- Dynamic calculations: "X cases/day needed to hit quarterly goal"
- Days off tracking (exclude from goal calculations)
- Net work day counts in selected periods

**üéØ Stretch Goals:**
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Integration with Dynamics 365 (pull case data automatically)
- OAuth login support
- Export to Excel/PDF
